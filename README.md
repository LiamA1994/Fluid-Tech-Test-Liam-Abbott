# Fluid-Tech-Test-Liam-Abbott

This is my technical test for Fluid.

A 'Read me' txt file should already be included also.

This will include all files and folders I did use for the technical test.

The database is stored in the 'Database' folder and all HTML and CSS along with scripts are under 'html'

The drupal side should contain a full content type, paragraph types, taxonomy terms and a view to display those taxonomy terms.
